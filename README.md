# DecisionTrees-Image-Classification
Alphabetical Letter Recognition

<h4>In these demo we are using <b>"Decision Trees"</b> </h4>

- Our database is composed by Learning Images and Test Images. <br/>
- We are using 2 python files (classes) : first one for the UI end the second one for the processing. <br/>
- For the UI we worked with : PyQT5. <br/>
- For the processing we worked with : OpenCV, Sklearn. <br/>
